# Writer

Writer is an easy screenwriting application based on the fountain language (see http://www.fountain.io), which is similar to markdown but optimized for screenwriting by automatically recognizing e.g. scene headers or dialogue. Writer is a standard cocoa document based application for OS X.
The repo contains the source code, as well as a pre-complied .app version (Needs to be started by right click -> Open to bypass Gatekeeper).
